Love always feels better when it's true
Love tastes way too bitter when it's you
I'm all out of love, you gave it away
I'm hoping that experience can get you to change

Find someone who's there for you
Find someone who's there for you
Love always feels better when it's true
Love tastes way too bitter when it's you
