You give me always my surprise, so tell me tell me why

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You treat me really like a toy

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Baby, make a make a make up, you're my set to make up

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000

Baby, love and love and love me

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Love is one that's one thing, the most important thing to do

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But you're killing my love, and everybody's sure

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The dreams they met, the hearts, you're killing my love

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And you move this journey, put together my love

14

You give me love, and you love me forever

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm gonna have a kiss with you together

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't want to believe in love anymore

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're gonna destroy my life

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I would think you'd do it come your way

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You can't believe I'm your life

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So tell me, tell me why

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You've been a lollipop at your home

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Baby, make a make a make a make up

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000

Baby, I just want to let you leave

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Baby, I love, I love, I love me

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Love is one, it's one thing

The most important thing to do

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000

And you've been loving me more

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Baby, make a make up, make a make up

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're my side to wake up

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Baby, I just want to let you leave

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Baby, I love, I love, I love me

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Love is one, it's one thing

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The most important thing to do

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But you're killing my love

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000

But you're killing my love

My views aren't performing

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
To hinder forever

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's просто between together

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
